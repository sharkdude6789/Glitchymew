-  Hi, I’m @GlitchyMew
-  I’m interested in coding in general.
-  I’m currently learning C, as I want to develop my own language, or perhaps be the next C extension. (also it is the mother of most languages like Python, so learning it will pretty much be a cheat sheet for every language)
-  I’m looking to collaborate on, well, nothing (I'm the person to break the team usually)
-  How to reach me: through my email: sharkdude6789@gmail.com
